# gflow-cli

> Unofficial Python CLI for Google Flow. Drive [Veo](https://labs.google/fx/tools/flow) (image-to-video, text-to-video) and Imagen (text-to-image) from your terminal: scripted, batched, pipeline-ready.

> ⚠️ **Read this before you install.** gflow-cli is **unofficial, alpha, and reverse-engineered — not affiliated with Google**. It drives a headed browser on *your own* Google Flow session, so treat it as your own account risk: automation is subject to Google's ToS, and endpoints or UI can change without notice. It works with **any Google account** that has Flow access, and every generation bills against your account's Flow credit allowance. Read the full [DISCLAIMER](DISCLAIMER.md).
>
> 🛡️ **"Will this get my account flagged?"** The honest, specific answer — what the tool does to stay unremarkable (headed real Chrome, randomised interaction timing, paced submissions), what it deliberately does **not** do (no proxies, no fingerprint spoofing, no pretending it isn't automation), what you can tune, and what we cannot promise — is in [docs/ACCOUNT_SAFETY.md](docs/ACCOUNT_SAFETY.md).
>
> 💳 **What failure costs you.** Credits are only spent on Veo *video* generation — images and composition ops are free, so most breakage costs nothing. When Flow's UI drifts mid-run, the CLI fails fast and loudly with distinct exit codes (e.g. selector drift = exit 23) instead of resubmitting, and batch items are recorded locally *before* submission so a broken run never silently burns credits on a stale state. See [KNOWN_ISSUES](KNOWN_ISSUES.md) for the current risk list.
>
> 🌐 **Headed browser today.** gflow drives Flow through a persistent Playwright Chromium profile, because Google's auth and reCAPTCHA gates require it. The [Architecture](#architecture--current-limitations) section shows where you can help.

## Why gflow-cli?

You have a Google account with Flow access, you have Veo credits, and you run real batch work. gflow-cli gives you:

- **Batch generation.** Loop prompts straight from the shell: `for p in $(cat prompts.txt); do gflow image t2i "$p"; done`. Image batching plus `gflow video t2v` / `i2v` / `r2v` all ship today, and `gflow video extend` continues an existing clip past Flow's 8s ceiling.
- **Consistent subjects.** `gflow character create` mints a Flow Character (face and body reference) so the same person appears from one generation to the next.
- **Prompt tools.** `--tool creative-director` rewrites a terse prompt into a vivid one (Google's 5-component formula) before generating — on any command. Bring your own with [My Tools](docs/TOOLS.md).
- **Pipelines.** Wire Veo into your content automation, AI-video stack, or batch experiments.
- **Terminal-native.** After one `gflow auth login`, you stay in the shell. No clicking through dialogs.

Same Veo and Imagen models, same quality, same billing against your own Google account, now programmatic.

## 60-second quick start

```bash
# 1 · Install (uv recommended; also: pip install gflow-cli)
uv tool install gflow-cli
uv tool run --from gflow-cli playwright install chromium     # one-time, ~150 MB

# 2 · Authenticate (one-time, opens a real Chrome window)
gflow auth login --browser chrome

# 3 · Generate
gflow image t2i "a hot air balloon over Tokyo at sunrise"
# or:
gflow video t2v "Slow cinematic push-in on a sunlit forest clearing" --aspect 16:9
# or mint a reusable Character (face + body reference):
gflow character create --project <id> --name "Aria" --face-prompt "..." --body-prompt "..."
```

Outputs land under `$GFLOW_CLI_OUTPUT_DIR`, or you can route them to S3, MinIO, or Google Cloud Storage with [`GFLOW_CLI_STORAGE_URI`](docs/EXTERNAL_STORAGE.md). The first call takes 30 to 90 seconds while Chromium warms up; later calls reuse the warm session.

> **Why `--browser chrome`?** Google rejects Playwright's bundled Chromium. The CLI fails fast with a friendly error (`AuthBrowserRejectedError`, exit code 14) if you pick anything else.

> **Installing from a local checkout?** `uv tool install <path>` **ignores `uv.lock`** and resolves dependencies from the `pyproject.toml` ranges, so it can hand you a Playwright build this project has never tested. Playwright ships the browser driver, and an untested minor can wedge a generation silently. Carry the locked version explicitly:
>
> ```bash
> uv tool install --force --with playwright==1.59.0 .
> ```
>
> Installing from PyPI (`uv tool install gflow-cli`) is unaffected — the published range is upper-bounded. Check what you actually have with `uv tool run --from gflow-cli python -c "import importlib.metadata as m; print(m.version('playwright'))"`.

## Examples

One command in, real Flow output back. Left: `gflow image t2i` generating a photorealistic scene in your library. Right: a frame-to-frame transform.

![gflow-cli examples: text-to-image generation, and a before/after frame transform](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/main/docs/assets/examples.webp)

## Demo

![gflow image t2i runs a single 9:16 prompt, streams structlog output, and writes a PNG to disk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ffroliva/gflow-cli/main/docs/assets/example-run.gif)

A single `gflow image t2i "..." --aspect 9:16 --model nano2` call against a logged-in Flow profile. The terminal streams the run's `structlog` JSON, then lists the written PNG. Chromium drives the Flow editor silently in the background.

Reproduce the recording with [`scripts/record_demo.ps1`](scripts/record_demo.ps1) (Windows, OBS, ffmpeg, gifski). More formats, including the side-by-side split-screen: **[docs/DEMOS.md](docs/DEMOS.md)**.

## Architecture & current limitations

```text
gflow CLI  →  Provider (interchangeable)  →  Flow (ui_automation) / Mock (tests) / [planned: Official Veo]
                                              ↓
                                      Playwright Chromium (headed — login AND generation, by default)
                                              ↓
                              aisandbox-pa.googleapis.com  (Google's private Flow API)
```

**Current transport:** `ui_automation` drives Flow through a persistent Playwright Chromium profile. It is production-stable and verified end-to-end every release (see the per-release `LIVE_VERIFICATION_*` evidence files).

**What's blocked:** a pure HTTP transport for video generation. The video upload endpoint returns HTTP 401 under non-Chrome browsers plus a reCAPTCHA mint we cannot reproduce headlessly. Three earlier HTTP strategies (`evaluate_fetch`, `bearer`, `sapisidhash`) live under `src/gflow_cli/api/transports/experimental/` for research, off the production path.

**How you can help:** if you have driven `aisandbox-pa.googleapis.com` from outside a real Chrome session, or you understand Google's anti-bot stack here, please open an issue. A working REST transport would unlock serverless deployments, true horizontal concurrency, and roughly 10x the project's reach. Details: [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md § Headed-browser dependency](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#headed-browser-dependency--current-limitation).

## Project status

**Alpha.** Image (t2i, i2i, upload, upscale, batch) and video (t2v, i2v, r2v, chain, extend) run end-to-end on `ui_automation`, with a 5-model Veo picker plus `--duration` and `--count`. Beyond single generations: `gflow movie` renders multi-scene manifests, `gflow instructions` manages persistent Agent-Mode brief cards (credits-free), `gflow character` handles reusable subjects, `gflow scene` does credit-free server-side stitching, `--tool` applies prompt-rewriting tools, and an MCP server (`gflow mcp run` stdio / `gflow serve` Streamable HTTP) exposes the core surface to AI agents with a CI-enforced CLI↔MCP parity contract.
